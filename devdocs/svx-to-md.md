Solutions to Maintain Portability

To ensure your files remain GitHub-friendly and portable, while still supporting `.svx` features in Quartz, here are some options:

1. Use `.md` for Core Notes and Reserve `.svx` for Advanced Use Cases

    Treat `.md` as the primary file format for standard notes, ensuring maximum readability and compatibility.
    Only use `.svx` for notes that require advanced interactivity or embedded Svelte components.
    This hybrid approach allows users to have the best of both worlds.

2. Add a `.svx-to-md` Export Feature

    Build an export tool in Quartz that strips out the Svelte-specific syntax from .svx files and converts them into clean .md files for sharing or uploading to GitHub.

    Example:

    ```md
    # My Interactive Note

    <script>
    import Counter from './Counter.svelte';
    </script>

    Here is a counter: <Counter />
    ```

    Exported `.md:`

    ```md
        # My Interactive Note

        Here is a counter: [Interactive Counter - only viewable in Quartz]
    ```

- This ensures `.svx` files remain functional within Quartz but still produce readable Markdown for external use.

3. Use Comments or Clear Fallbacks for Svelte-Specific Syntax

    Add comments or fallbacks in your .svx files to make them readable in plain text viewers like GitHub.
    Example:
    
    ```md

    # My Interactive Note

    <!-- This note contains an interactive Counter. -->
    <!-- Use Quartz to view the interactive version. -->

    [Interactive Counter Placeholder]
    ```

2. Leverage Custom GitHub Previews

    Write a custom preprocessor (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to render .svx files into plain .md files for viewing on GitHub. This ensures that even advanced notes display cleanly when browsed online.

3. Provide a Viewer Tool

    Create a lightweight Quartz-powered viewer (hosted or self-hosted) that lets users browse .svx files in their full glory without needing to install Quartz or clone the repo. Include a link in the GitHub README.

Recommendation for Quartz

    Use .md as your default format for maximum compatibility and portability.
    Treat .svx as an optional advanced format for users who need Svelte features, while providing tools like .svx-to-md export or readable fallbacks for better portability.

This way, you preserve the elegance and functionality of .svx without losing the readability and compatibility that .md offers.
